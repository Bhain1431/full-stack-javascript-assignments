 //Above there are examples of the six primitive types. String, Number,
// Null, Undefined, Boolean, and Symbol.

// Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true, and false.

 // The Null type has exactly one value: null.

 // A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.

 // There is no specific type for integers. In addition to being able to represent floating-point numbers, the number type has three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not-a-number).

//  avaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at' +
//' index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it./*

//A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property (see below). In some programming languages, Symbols are called atoms.,
